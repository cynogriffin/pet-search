# Space Launch Tracker

## Description

This project is aimed at providing a one-stop-shop for everything related to space launches. It is a resource for space enthusiasts seeking the most up-to-date information on current space events. On this site, you are able to get information on upcoming space launches happening around the world, the most current space launch news, and a daily dose of interesting information on space. In the Launch Schedule section, you can see the next ten upcoming global space launches with the estimated launch time and information on each launch (if it's not classified). Next, the Spaceflight News section is updated with the most recent news in the field of space flight. Lastly, the Space Picture of the Day presents you with stunning images of space and information on the subject of the picture.

To track the space launches, we used the [Launch Library 2 API](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi). To retrieve the latest spaceflight news, we used the [Spaceflight News API](https://spaceflightnewsapi.net/). For the space picture of the day, we implemented the [NASA APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/). As far as styling, the primary CSS framework we implemented is [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/) with a little help from [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/defaulT.asp). Lastly, to help with date formatting of launch times, we utilized [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/).
